Each use case specifies a unit of useful functionality that the subject provides to its users, i.e., a specific way of interacting with the subject. This functionality, which is initiated by an actor, must always be completed for the use case to complete. It is deemed complete if, after its execution, the subject will be in a state in which no further inputs or actions are expected and the use case can be initiated again or in an error state.\\r\\n\\r\\nUse cases can be used both for specification of the (external) requirements on a subject and for the specification of the functionality offered by a subject. Moreover, the use cases also state the requirements the specified subject poses on its environment by defining how they should interact with the subject so that it will be able to perform its services.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe behavior of a use case can be described by a specification that is some kind of Behavior (through its ownedBehavior relationship), such as interactions, activities, and state machines, or by pre-conditions and post-conditions as well as by natural language text where appropriate. It may also be described indirectly through a Collaboration that uses the use case and its actors as the classifiers that type its parts.
